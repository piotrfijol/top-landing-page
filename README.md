# [TOP] Landing Page

Another quick refresher, this time on CSS and flexbox.

The main goal of this project is to [recreate this design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png). 
In this project in contrast to [the last TOP assignment that I did](https://github.com/piotrfijol/top-recipes) there is also CSS involved.
